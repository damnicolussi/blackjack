# Blackjack | Stochastic Phenomena Simulation with Python

School project of simulation of stochastic phenomena with Python

## Request

Your aim is to simulate a game of blackjack using Python, suppose you Each game goes to one bet and the initial bet is 5. The player bets according to the scheme: "if the player wins bets the same amount again, otherwise bets double".
To decide whether to draw a new card, the player must calculate in mind the probability of drawing a card from the deck that is to him "advantageous", based on the cards he can actually see on the table. If the probability of drawing a "profitable" card is greater than a certain percentage p then the player asks for another card. Have p drawn randomly in the range 20%-100% (depending on how bold you feel with each hand).
The game must continue until the player doubles the initial amount or lose everything or there are no more cards in the deck. Consider 100 as initial amount. Simulate 1 million matches: how many times does the dealer win in percentage and how many times does the player win? Try to change the starting amount or bets as desired random and check if the result changes, make charts that represent how much obtained.
